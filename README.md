These are my playground notebooks and example files while reading the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1549901544&sr=8-3&keywords=hands-on+machine+learning+with+scikit-learn) by Aurélien Géron. Most of it is a rip off of https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml

I've made some minor modifications to the original notebooks just for clarification while i use them for personal reference.
